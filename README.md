# fastfetch-configs
I'm just gonna host all the different stuff I made for fastfetch here in case anyone wants to use them as inspiration :D<br/>
All the files are just `number.jsonc`, but some will also have a text file that go with them so look out for that.

## Usage:
Check out the [Fastfetch repo](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) for installation instructions.<br />
The [Wiki](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/wiki/Configuration) provides in-depth instructions for configuration and generating a config file.
